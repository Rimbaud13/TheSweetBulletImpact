# TheSweetBulletImpact

This is a first person shooter-survival game I wrote with a friend [Leandro Kieliger](https://github.com/lkieliger) back in 2012 for a high school project.

The game is based upon Irrlicht, a game engine, IrrBullet, a physics engine and IrrKlang, a sound manager.

It is important to note that at the time, we had little to no programming knowledge. Consequently this code is currently considered as deprecated as it is barely readable and doesn't follow any good programming practice. We don't have any short-term plan to re-write it although it may be a good programming exercise.
