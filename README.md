# TheSweetBulletImpact

This is a first person shooter-survival game.

I wrote it in 2012 with a friend, with barely any knowledge in programming. 
Everything is done using Irrlicht, a game engine, IrrBullet, a physics engine, IrrKlang, a sound manager.

I consider this code deprecated, it is barely readable, and I won't take the time to make it portable.
I will add some screenshots soon.
